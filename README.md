# Number to Words Converter (Portuguese - PT-BR)

This is a simple **Python script** that converts numbers from **0 to 9,999,999.99** into their **full written form in Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR)**.

Unlike money formatters, this script does **not** include currency units like "reais" or "centavos". Instead, if a decimal point exists, it is written out using the word **"vírgula"** (comma in Portuguese).
